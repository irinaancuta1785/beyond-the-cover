A community-driven platform that brings readers together to discover and discuss books they love.

# 📚 Beyond the cover

## 🧩 Project Overview
**Beyond The Cover** is a website I built for my first year project. It's basically a book club website where people can see upcoming book discussions and book their spot to join.

I wanted to create something that looks professional but is still simple enough for me to build with just HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap (no JavaScript yet since we haven't really covered that properly).

The idea is that users can browse through different books we're discussing in December 2025, see the dates and times, and click a button to book their spot. There's also a monthly pass option if someone wants to join all the discussions.

## 🏗️ Planning and Design Process

### **Who Is This Site For?**
When I was planning this, I thought about who would actually use it:
- People who love reading and want to discuss books with others
- Someone who's curious about joining a book club for the first time
- Regular members who want to book their next session
- Anyone looking for the club's contact details

### **What Do They Want to Do?**
I tried to think about what people would want when they visit:
- See what books are being discussed
- Find out when the discussions are happening
- Book a spot without it being complicated
- Maybe get a monthly pass if they're really keen
- Contact the club if they have questions

## 🧱 Site Structure

Right now it's just one page (might add more pages later). The page includes:

1. **Navigation Bar** – At the top with links to different sections. It sticks to the top when you scroll which I learned how to do from Bootstrap docs.

2. **Hero Section** – Big image with a quote from George R.R. Martin (Game of Thrones author!) about reading. Below that there's a "Discussion Guide" section that explains how the book discussions work.

3. **Book Discussion Cards** – This is the main part where I show 6 different books. Each card has the book cover, title, author, a short description, and when the discussion is happening. There's a "Book Your Spot" button on each one.

4. **Monthly Pass Banner** – A special section at the bottom offering a monthly pass for people who want to join all discussions.

5. **Footer** – Contact information, quick links, and copyright info. I used Bootstrap for this too.
